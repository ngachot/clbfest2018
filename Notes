Most vendor licensing agreements often include limitations of liability that disproportionately favor the vendor.

Consider the following disclaimer: Licensor shall not be liable to licensee for any lost profits, lost revenues or opportunities, downtime, or any consequential damages or costs, resulting from any claim or cause of action based on breach of warranty, breach of contract, negligence, or any other legal theory, even if Licensor knew or should have know of the possibility thereof.
