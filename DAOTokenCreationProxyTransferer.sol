 * By default, token creation can be executed on behalf of another address using
 * the TokenCreation.sol createTokenProxy() function This contract is used as a
 * fall back in case an exchange doesn't implement the "add data to a
 * transaction" feature in a timely manner, preventing it from calling
 * createTokenProxy().  Calling this contract automatically triggers a call to
 * createTokenProxy() using the correct parameters for a given participant in
 * the token creation.  A unique instance of such a contract would have to be
 * deployed per participant, usually using a middleware layer on a webserver,
 * for example.
