2018 Computational Law & amp; Blockchain Festival Hackathon Project

This project is a derivative work of the DAO contract adapted to provide minimum viable governance for a collective of developers. Individuals can join and leave the collective, contribute to the collective, and have clear guidance on what they are agreeing to when they contribute to the collective. It is designed to protect individuals from personal liability and to maintain clear copyright rights in the collective work.

To further the usefulness of this project, we would like to integrate ERC721 tokens so that a contract may govern copyrights of images, movies, collectibles, etc. and allow for assignment of copyright rights.
